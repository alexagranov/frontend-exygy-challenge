1.Started trying to pick apart another project of mine as that seemed the fastest route, as I could pick up my preferred configs, directory structure, transpiler settings, etc but that proved to be a bear because that project is using react-intl which ends up wrapping everything (the provider, components, etc) and ripping it out was going to be time-consuming.  I decided to go with react-production-starter (renamed razzle) as it looked interesting and wanted to try something new.
1. Tried at first to include frontend-challenge-pattern-library as a dependency rather than cloning to sibling directory of the React app - but for some reason couldn't get handlebars-template-loader to be able to compile the files from `node_modules`.  Ended up just cloning the pattern library to a sibling directory and importing files individually.
